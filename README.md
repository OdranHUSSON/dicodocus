## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up Dicodocus, ensure you have the following:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed
- A [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) project
- An OpenAI API key for AI-powered features

### Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/dicodocus.git
   cd dicodocus
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the required environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project:
   ```env
   DOCUSAURUS_ROOT_PATH=/path/to/docusaurus/root
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCUSAURUS_DEFAULT_LANG=en
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCUSAURUS_URL=http://localhost:3003
   DOCUSAURUS_ENABLED_LANGS=en,es,fr,de
   DOCUSAURUS_MEDIA_DIR=static/img
   OPEN_AI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
   ```

   Docusaurus_url is used to fetch media ( image / videos ) uploaded to the docusaurus static folder
